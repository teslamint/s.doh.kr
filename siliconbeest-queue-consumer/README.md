# SiliconBeest Queue Consumer

Asynchronous job processor for SiliconBeest. This Cloudflare Worker consumes messages from two Cloudflare Queues (federation and internal) and dispatches each message to the appropriate handler.

---

## What It Does

- Delivers ActivityPub activities to remote servers with HTTP Signatures, Linked Data Signatures, and Object Integrity Proofs.
- Fans out activity deliveries to multiple remote inboxes (grouped by shared inbox).
- Forwards activities to remote servers with original signature preservation.
- Fans out new statuses to follower home timelines and emits streaming events.
- Creates notifications for mentions, follows, favourites, boosts, and reactions, with web push and streaming.
- Processes uploaded media (thumbnails, metadata extraction) in R2.
- Fetches and caches remote account profiles from federated servers.
- Fetches and caches remote statuses/notes from federated servers.
- Fetches OpenGraph metadata for URL preview cards.
- Sends Web Push notifications to subscribed client endpoints.

> **Note:** Email sending is handled by a separate dedicated worker ([siliconbeest-email-sender](../siliconbeest-email-sender/)), which consumes from its own `email` queue. This consumer does NOT process email messages.

## Message Types

All messages use a discriminated union on the `type` field. The consumer reads `msg.body.type` and routes to the matching handler.

## Configuration

The consumer is configured in `wrangler.jsonc`:

### Bindings

| Binding            | Service | Purpose                                                      |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `DB`               | D1      | Read/write database for notifications, timelines, account cache |
| `MEDIA_BUCKET`     | R2      | Read/write media files during processing                     |
| `CACHE`            | KV      | Cache remote actor/status lookups                            |
| `QUEUE_FEDERATION` | Queues  | Re-enqueue federation jobs (fanout -> individual deliveries) |
| `QUEUE_INTERNAL`   | Queues  | Re-enqueue internal jobs                                     |
| `WORKER`           | Service | Service binding to main worker (for Durable Object access)  |

### Queue Consumer Settings

| Queue                      | Max Retries | Dead Letter Queue              |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| `siliconbeest-federation`  | 5           | `siliconbeest-federation-dlq`  |
| `siliconbeest-internal`    | 3           | (none)                         |

## How Federation Delivery Works

1. The main worker creates a status or processes an interaction. It enqueues a `deliver_activity_fanout` message to the federation queue.
2. The consumer picks up the fanout message, queries the database for all remote followers, groups them by shared inbox, and enqueues one `deliver_activity` message per unique inbox.
3. Each `deliver_activity` handler:
   - Constructs the ActivityPub JSON-LD payload
   - Signs it with the actor's RSA private key using HTTP Signatures (draft-cavage)
   - Attaches Linked Data Signatures for relay forwarding
   - Attaches Object Integrity Proofs (Ed25519) when applicable
   - POSTs it to the remote inbox
4. On success, `msg.ack()` removes the message from the queue.
5. On failure, `msg.retry()` re-enqueues the message for another attempt (up to the max retry count).

### Activity Forwarding

When a forwarded activity is received (e.g., a reply to a local post from a remote follower), the consumer can forward the activity to other followers while preserving the original HTTP signature via the `forward_activity` message type.

---

## Retry and Dead Letter Queue Behavior

- **Federation queue**: Messages are retried up to **5 times**. After all retries are exhausted, the message is moved to the `siliconbeest-federation-dlq` dead letter queue for manual inspection.
- **Internal queue**: Messages are retried up to **3 times**. Failed messages are dropped after exhausting retries (no DLQ configured).
- Each handler catches errors individually: on success it calls `msg.ack()`, on error it calls `msg.retry()` and logs the error.

---

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Note: Queue consumption in local development requires `wrangler dev` to be running for both the main worker and the consumer simultaneously. Messages enqueued by the worker will be delivered to the consumer in the local environment.

## How to Add New Handlers

1. Define your new message type in `src/shared/types/queue.ts`:

```typescript
export type QueueMessage =
  | { type: 'deliver_activity'; /* ... */ }
  | { type: 'my_new_job'; payload: MyPayload }
  // ...
```

2. Create a handler file in `src/handlers/`:

```typescript
// src/handlers/myNewJob.ts
import { env } from 'cloudflare:workers';
import type { MyNewJobMessage } from '../shared/types/queue';

export async function handleMyNewJob(
  msg: MyNewJobMessage,
  env: Env
): Promise<void> {
  // your logic here
}
```

3. Add the case to the switch in `src/index.ts`:

```typescript
case 'my_new_job':
  await handleMyNewJob(msg.body, env);
  break;
```

4. In the main worker, enqueue messages using the appropriate queue binding:

```typescript
await env.QUEUE_INTERNAL.send({ type: 'my_new_job', payload: { ... } });
```
